<h2>How to recover a .h File.</H2>

<P>The .xy file never changes, and the .m file changes every turn. Both are available on the hosting server. But what of the .h file? 

<P>The .h file exists ONLY on your local computer. You should back it up regularly. However, if you lose it, don't depair; you can recreate it (OK, despair a little - this is a pain). Each turn, the .h file appends/updates the history from past turns. The path to recovering it is to just open up all the past turns. 

<P>Step 1: If you still have a .h file, back it up. 

<P>Step 2: Select the "Get History" option on TotalHost. This will give you a .ZIP file of all your past turns. Extract them to a new folder.

<P>Step 3: Create another new folder (such as "RecoverH"). In that folder place the game .xy file, and your .m file from Year 2400. (If you only need to recover part of a .h file, you can start at that turn). 

<P>Step 4: Open the .m file, and select "Save and Submit" (which triggers the update of the .h file). 

<P>Step 5: In your new folder, copy in the .m file for the next turn (year 2401).

<P>Step 6: Go back to repeat Steps 4 and 5 for all the turns (Open the .m file, and select "Save and Submit", then copy in the next turn). 

<P>Step 7: Copy the .h file from the new folder to the folder where you normally store the turn files for your game. 

<P>Step 8. Download and open your current turn. Your history should now be there. 

<P>Step 9: Devise a backup plan for your .h file - you don't want to do this again!
