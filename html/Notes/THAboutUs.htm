<h2>About Us</h2>
<P>I've been playing Stars! a long time -- since its initial shareware release. I even still have my original floppy disc for my Registered copy of Stars! v. 1.0. At one point I was the most prolific poster on the rec.computer.games.stars! newsgroup. That is, until Jason Cawley came along. Jason was a juggernaut on the site, and his insights and analysis of the game changed the very nature of how the game was played. 

<P>Ron Miller published the Stars! AutoHost site, which revolutionized on-line hosting. However, it never quite did all the things I wanted a hosting site to do, so I continued to host my games manually. 

<P>Eventually I decided to build my own hosting site. After all, how hard could it be? Well, after working on it for a while, development stalled some time in 2004, and mostly never started up again. That code base went on to help solve a number of OTHER programming projects, but I never finished the actual Stars! hosting code. 

<P>Returning to Stars! many years later I still had the same desires for hostingy. While I had considerably more programming experience, the Internet had changed, and most of what I had done was no longer compatible with more modern expectations. 

<P>So, back to the drawing board. I've now integrated all of that older code into my more "modern" programming (for all that it's still Perl). While I continue to add features, Totalhost finally does what I wanted - host Stars! the way I wanted scheduling to work while also being "aware" of the contents of Stars! turn files. 

<P>The AutoHost site is a LOT of information. I have no urge to replicate (or replace) the information and community centered around the AutoHost site. So much so that when Ron  stepped away from managing and hosting the Autohost website, I assumed ownership of the Stars! Wiki, Forum, and Autohost as well. 

<P>The Autohost site is great, but contains so much content it can be hard to find any one thing. I've distilled down those resources here to those I think most useful to a new player. Once you have your feet under you, spend a while rummaging about on <a href="https://starsautohost.org">AutoHost</a>. 

<P>I hope you find Totalhost useful. 

<P>Peace (through superior firepower). 

<P>Rick
