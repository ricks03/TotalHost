<h2>How Stars! Score is Calculated</h2>

<ul>
<li>Planets:  From 1 to 6 points, scoring 1 point for each 100,000 colonists
<li>Starbases: 3 points each (doesn't include Orbital Forts)
<li>Unarmed Ships: An unarmed ship has a power rating of 0. You receive 1/2 point for each unarmed ship (up to the number of planets you own).
<li>Escort Ships: An escort ship has a power rating greater than 0 and less than 2000. You receive 2 points for each Escort ship (up to the number of planets you own).
<li>Capital Ships A Capital ship has a power rating of greater than 1999.  For each capital ship, you receive points calculated by the following formula:
<li>Points = (8 * #_capital_ships * #_planets) /( #_capital_ships + #_planets). For example, if you have 20 capital ships and 30 planets, you receive (8 x 20 x 30) / (20 + 30) or 4.8 points for each ship.
<li>Tech Levels:  
<ul>
<li>1 point for levels 1-3,
<li>2 points for levels 4-6,
<li>3 points for levels 7-9,
<li>4 points for level 10 and above
</ul>
<li>Resources: 1 point for every 30 resources
</ul>
