<li>Repeat until you crush them all</li>

<P>Welcome to Stars!

(If you want to create a custom universe locally, but play on TotalHost, select "Create Game" on TH. Then, select the "Upload Zip" button and upload your game (with all appropriate .hst, .xy, and .m files). The game will be assigned you as host AND all players. Change each of the players to the approrpate TH User ID, and you're all set!
