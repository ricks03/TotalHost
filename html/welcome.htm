<P><h1><center>Welcome to Stars! Total Hosting</center></h1>

<P>Now able to identify (and correct for) common Stars! bugs, exploits, and shared data issues!</p>

<P>TotalHost (TH), much like AutoHost, is a web-based interface for Stars! game and turn-management. TH builds off the concept of AutoHost, but adds a number of features such as:

<ul>
<li>Web-based game creation
<li>More options for host, player and game management & turn generation
<li>A player-delay system, permitting regulation of player-requested delays, much like timeouts in sports
<li>Configurable player inactivation (and setting to Housekeeping AI)
<li>The ability to download the game history (to better recreate the .h file, view in retrospect, and/or recover from system failure)
<li>Storage and viewing of race files (including uncorrupting them)
<li>Host ability to reset a dropped player's Stars! password
<li>Detecting exploits in the Stars! code, and warning (or even correcting) for them
<li>Cleaning/removing other player information stored in turn files
<li>End-game movies and scores
<li>Providing a serial number with every user profile
</ul>
