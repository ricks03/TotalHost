<h2>Strategy Tips</h2>

<P>Your race will start at 15% research. Set that to 0%, and leave it there until you're in a hurry. That 15% will instead get invested in your early factories, and in the end you'll get more tech faster that way.

<P>Growth starts to decrease at 25%. Until 33% you grow slower, but still create more people than you are losing growth. After 33%, and really after 50%, the growth rate on a planet starts to decrease. 

<P>Breeding. From the above, use planets with a high growth to make/grow people and transport those people to max out low growth planets.

<P>Germanium. Provide new planets with all that they need, and the planet will start producing resources faster because they can start building factories.

<P>Upgrade your starbase!  It's really cheap compared to building a new one. Upgrades can be even cheaper if you upgrade slots in a coordinated fashion. 

<P>Don't keep building your original starbase design; it's junk. For new starbases start from a blank tempate and work your way up as you upgrade. 

<P>Once someone encounters one of your starbases, they then "know" the design of all identical starbases. Upgrade them all (even if to a duplciate/identical design) to hide the design from all of your planets.

<P>Once you have zero starbases of a select design you can edit it (instead of deleting it and starting a new design). Doing so will leave your foes still seeing the same (old) starbase design in their scanners until they encounter it again.

<P>Minefields. Even a few can slow an enemy's early attack and buy you some time to build up a defense. 

<P>A single ship design (typically missile) dedicated to knocking down bombers can help. Bombers (and freighters) are really weak. A sacrificial few ships with the battle plan to "Destroy Bombers" could knock out the enemy bombers. Then it's only an enemy fleet in orbit with no ability to affect your production until they get a new bomber fleet in place. That can buy you YEARS if your opponent didn't plan for it. 

<P>Weapons Tech. It's a good idea to have it be 50% cheap. Most of the other techs continue to get better slowly, but you're always going to want better weapons.

<P>Bio Tech. If you look at the tech tree, you won't care much about Bio after about Tech 8. It's fairly standard to have this be 75% expensive. 

<P>The Need for Speed. You can increase the default speed of a ship; it just takes more fuel. Do so whenever possible. Each warp increase is wildly faster (16,25,36,49,64,81). Two warps faster is ~2x faster. That can mean  your economy is working 2x faster. You need only half as many ships. If fuel use is too high because of your engines, add fuel transports, or cheap scouts to the fleet to boost the available fuel. 

<P>Shield stacking is wildly powerful, esp. in the early game where beams rule. You want stacks of the same design of ship, with lots of shields. When udner attack by beams, before any ships are damaged, ALL of the shields have to be taken down. That means your offensive firepower (much like D&D Hit Points) doesn't decrease as long as the shields stay up.

<P>Ship transfers. If your race doesn't have pen scanning, can you get someone to transfer ships to you with pen scanners? If you can't lay heavy minefields, can you get a SD player to transfer a few to you?

<P>Race Design. The following is relevant for synergistic race design:
<ul>Standard Terraforming
<li>Radiation - Weapons Tech
<li>Temp - Energy Tech
<li>Gravity - Propulsion Tech
</ul>
 <ul>Packet Terraforming
<li>Temp - Boranium
<li>Gravity - Iron
<li>Radiation - Germanium
</ul>

<P>Race Design - The different LRTs vary in cost based on a number of factors, incuding PRT. The cost increases even more after five are selected.

<P>You can tell if someone has you set to Friend if their starbases refuel your ships.

<P>Defenses. If an opponent might have mass drivers (say Mass Driver 7), take into account what they can do when considering defenses. For Warp 7 drivers, any planet can be hit within 150 light years with no ability to respond; the packet can arrive before you can do anything about it. On the other hand, defenses are expensive. For the cost of defenses you can build a mobile fleet to defend your worlds. They should be the last thing you build, and only if you need it. 

<P>Planets with environments near the edge of the spectrum have a good chance of being super-rich in one or more minerals. 

<P>Frigates have a time window where stacked frigates rule. But that window ends once ships can do enough damage to the base hull armor. 

<P>Space docks are very useful for early construction. But Star bases are more durable, with higher armor and shield abilities, as well as more firepower and initiative potential. 

<P>Mobility. Drive your ships as fast as you can to arrive at their destination. Use scouts to supplant their available fuel. Star gates can be (mostly) safely used well over capacity. Every year you lose on transit is a year your opponent gains. 

<P>If you're under attack, do what you can to hide your tech levels and ship designs as long as possible. Your opponent is building ships he thinks can beat yours; the long he keeps building a design that might be flawed the better.

<P>If you're about to go into a fight blind, it can be useful to have scouts arrive 1 year early to provide intel on what you're walking into.
