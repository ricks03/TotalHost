<P>Our privacy policy is simple. 

<P>Every time you visit a web page, you send a lot of information to the web server. We collect all the information that we can from you and your system that your web browser provides. 

<P>Most web servers routinely maintain access logs with a portion of this information, 
which can be used to get an overall picture of what pages are popular, what other sites link to this one, 
and what web browsers people are using. Log data may be examined in the course of solving technical 
problems, in tracking down badly-behaved web spiders 
that overwhelm the site, or very rarely to correlate usernames and network addresses while investigating 
abuse of the site.

<P>We place a cookie on your machine with a session ID so we can improve your site experience, 
but that also means we can track your movement around the site. 
You have to permit this cookie for the site to work. 

<P>We also collect the information you type into the site.  If we didn't, then when you came back it would be gone, and you'd have to type it in again.

<P>You should expect that personal information you enter on the site will be visible to others who visit the site. 
If there's something you don't want people to know, don't enter it on our site. 

<P>We won't sell, rent, or trade your information to 3rd parties, and will only provide that information to 3rd parties 
as is required for maintenance of the site, or as required by law. We may provide aggregate statistics about our clients, 
traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will not include 
personally identifying information. 

<P>That being said, there are people hacking on websites all the time. All of the passwords are encrypted, but everything else isn't. While we will attempt to maintain the website in a patched and secure fashion, we are not in a position to guarantee these standards. There may be factors, including but not limited to those beyond our control, that may result in disclosure of data. As a consequence, we disclaim any warranties or representations relating to maintenance or nondisclosure of Data.

<P>If you don't want people to know you were here, leave now. Delete the cookie from your system, change ISPs, and throw away your computer. 

<P>They might not find you then, but then again, they might.
