        Races</B><BR>----------------------------<BR><BR>ARs work very 
        differently than the other races in Stars. This section touches on each 
        significant difference, and its effect on race design or game 
        play.<BR><BR>** Starbase Habitat: ARs live in starbases. Thus, while 
        they use the planetary compat as do normal races for purposes of 
        determining the growth-rate modification of the pop growth formula, they 
        do *not* have the same planetary maximum populations. Instead, they get 
        a fixed maxpop determined by the starbase type:<BR>orbital fort 
        250000<BR>space dock 500000<BR>space station 1000000<BR>ultra station 
        2000000<BR>death star 3000000<BR><BR>The most obvious effect of starbase 
        habitat is that when the starbase is lost, so is the pop. It is thus 
        much easier to attack an AR than a normal race, since you don't need 
        bombers.<BR><BR>** No factories: ARs cannot make factories, but rather, 
        get resources based on other factors (see below). As with any 
        factoryless race, this means that the need for early minerals is 
        modest.<BR><BR>A less obvious effect of being without factories is that 
        settlements are cheap. Though they can be lost easily, they are also 
        fast to set up. If a normal race loses a planet and it gets bombed out, 
        that race may have to spend 10 to 20 turns to get the factories back up. 
        The cost in germanium (G) is large, probably requiring imports. An AR 
        can have a planet back in business in 2 turns, costing only a few 
        minerals.<BR><BR>** AR mining: unlike normal races, an AR gets a small 
        number of "mines" just by being at a planet. The amount is 
        1/10sqrt(pop); thus, a planet with 250000 pop has the effect of 50 
        mines. Not very much. Offsetting this weakness is the special rule about 
        remote mining for AR planets: unlike any planet occupied by normal 
        races, an AR planet may always be remote mined.<BR><BR>** Infinite 
        mining: Unlike the normal races, when an AR remote mines a homeworld 
        that it owns (meaning, has colonized), the homeworld floor of 30 
        concentration applies to *all* of the AR's remote mining fleets at that 
        planet. This means that an AR can mine an almost unlimited amount per 
        turn, each turn, needing only the remote miners to do so. (Remote mining 
        for all players is subject to a limit of 4000 mine-equivalents per 
        fleet; thus, ARs are limited in remote mining by the 512 fleet 
        limit.)<BR><BR>Thus, if the AR makes it to the late game, where tech is 
        maxxed and minerals are tight, he is a great position. Other races will 
        be spending most of their resources doing highly inefficient alchemy. 
        ARs will be spending all of their resources building, assuming they set 
        up their mineral distribution network properly. This is potentially a 
        game breaker.<BR><BR>** Resource Formula: the formula for AR resources 
        is:<BR>resources-from-planet = hab * sqrt(pop * energy / 
        pop-coefficient)<BR>where:<BR>hab = the planetary habitat<BR>sqrt = 
        square root<BR>pop = the pop at that planet<BR>energy = the AR's energy 
        tech<BR>pop-coefficient = the value from the race wizard<BR>There are 
        effects to all of these, so I will discuss each in turn.<BR><BR>hab: 
        unlike normal races, the planetary habitat directly affects the 
        production of an AR. This means that, all other things equal, an AR will 
        do better with fewer, higher hab planets than with more low hab ones. 
        The value for "hab" is never lower than 0.25; if the planet is lower 
        value than that (or red), then 0.25 is used instead. This, combined with 
        the pop limits based on the starbase, make ARs good at working up 
        reds.<BR><BR>sqrt: the effect of this is huge. It means that all the 
        factors inside it -- pop, energy, and pop-coefficient -- are "squelched" 
        in effect. The larger they get, the less they matter. You will see the 
        "square root effect" mentioned several more times in this 
        guide...<BR><BR>pop: with the sqrt, this factor means that an AR gets 
        fewer and fewer resources as a planet's pop increases. Normal races have 
        a tough problem with their planets: do they want to use them to grow pop 
        on, or to run factories at? If they decide to grow pop, they have to 
        hold the planet between 1/4 and 1/2 full; obviously that cuts the 
        possible production by the same amount. ARs grow using the same formula, 
        but the effect on them is much less: if the AR leaves the planet at 1/4 
        pop, he loses only half the resources (sqrt(0.25) = 0.5). If he leaves 
        it at 1/3 maxpop, which is the level yielding the largest pop/turn, he 
        loses only 42% of the resources.<BR><BR>This effect, combined with the 
        raised planetary maxpop obtained from starbase living, means that ARs 
        are considerably less dependent on a high growth rate (%grow) than 
        normal races. A typical (OBRM) normal race has a planetary max pop that 
        tops out at 1100000. (JOATs get 20% more.) In order to grow on average 
        at a competitive rate, say, 10% or so over the first 50 years, a normal 
        race needs to have a much higher growth rate -- 17-19% is typical. ARs 
        can grow their pop much more easily, especially after they get the 
        larger stations.<BR><BR>Another very important aspect of the sqrt(pop) 
        effect is its effect on the maximum rate of economic growth possible for 
        ARs. If pop is growing exponentially at rate R, a normal race can 
        increase its economy at rate R. (Usually factories will lag pop, so the 
        effect is somewhat delayed in the early game, but over time this is the 
        case.) What holds back a normal race is crowding and low planet values. 
        An AR, though, growing at the same rate R, gains econ at only rate 
        (R/2)! Crowding holds an AR back somewhat less, low planet values the 
        same. But in general, this fact means it is much harder to grow the AR 
        economy than the normal race economy.<BR><BR>One final aspect of the 
        sqrt(pop) factor is spreading. A normal race gets no immediate benefit 
        for spreading its pop out, as long as all planets are below maxpop. 
        (Spreading can increase the rate of growth, though, for planets above 
        1/4 maxpop. Thus, it is certainly a good idea, but not imperative.) For 
        ARs, though, because of the sqrt(pop) factory, spreading immediately 
        increases the economy, as well as potentially increasing the growth 
        rate. For example, assume an AR has two 100% planet available. If he 
        puts 1M pop on one, and zero on the other, he gets sqrt(1M*energy/eff), 
        or 1000sqrt(energy/eff). If he puts 500K on each planet, he gets 
        2*sqrt(500K*energy/eff), or 1414sqrt(energy/eff). 41% more, just for 
        rearranging where the pop is!<BR><BR>Note, though, that the amount an AR 
        gets from spreading drops off, again as a result of the square root. 
        Spreading his pop from 1 planet to 4, an AR can double his econ. But to 
        quadruple it, he needs 16 planets. And to octuple it, he needs 64. 
        Obviously, this process is only good for a relatively small amount of 
        growth; getting 16 planets is possible in most typical games. Getting 64 
        is unusual. Getting 256 is very unlikely -- if you are playing in a 
        galaxy that large, you are an idiot.<BR><BR>(In theory, a 6% AR could 
        spread his initial 55000 pop out into a large packed (910 planets), and 
        get a 30x boost of his economy. Of course, this would be less than 100 
        pop per planet. With some early growth, though, there would be enough 
        pop for 100/planet; with energy 10, say, this would have an economy of 
        around 7900 resources! Growing at 3%/year, and assuming energy 26, this 
        would get to 55000 resources by year 50.)<BR><BR>energy: obviously, this 
        one means that taking energy cheap or normal will be a good idea. Which 
        is generally true; note, however, that the sqrt involved means that the 
        AR gets diminishing returns the higher his energy goes. Going from 
        energy 1 to 2 means a dramatic 41% increase in resources (and the cost 
        is very low). Going from 10 to 11 means a modest 4.9% increase (and the 
        cost is also higher). Since the cost increases and the return decreases 
        the higher you go, cheap energy is not as important as it would 
        initially seem. Note, though, that the cost of energy research is a 
        fixed amount per level, whereas the benefit applies empire wide. So, if 
        your total economy is 1000 resources, getting energy 11 probably does 
        not make sense; you are paying over 1000 resources for a gain of 
        49/turn. If your economy is up to 10000, though, you pay 1000 for a gain 
        of 490/turn. That's a very good deal.<BR><BR>pop-coefficient: you drop 
        this from 1/10 to 1/25, you get 600 points. That's a lot. But you lose 
        37% (sqrt((1/25)/(1/10)) = 0.63) of your econ... that is also a lot. 
        <BR><BR>** Movement losses: 2% of the AR pop on a freighter dies when it 
        moves. This is annoying, but a typical AR has so much pop that it is 
        hardly noticed. It can be bad for low growth ARs, though. In this case, 
        there is an important feature (or defect, perhaps) to be aware of: the 
        2% is rounded off. Thus, if you have 2200 or less pop in a fleet, you 
        lose zero. Each 3300 (or fraction thereof) added to that, you lose 
        100/turn. <BR><BR><BR><BR><B>Grand 
        Strategy</B><BR>--------------<BR><BR>The grand strategy of all ARs is 
        the same. You are strong in two parts of the game: the very start (where 
        you get big resource gains from spreading and energy tech, and when you 
        have resources to spend and nobody else does), and the end (where you 
        have minerals, but nobody else does). Thus, the game that an AR hopes 
        for is to use the first period to get established on a good number of 
        planets without angering his neighbors. Then, he plays defensively, 
        using diplomacy to avoid conflict as much as possible, building up his 
        economy and tech, playing to survive until the end. Once minerals become 
        scarce, he can go forth and conquer.<BR><BR><BR><B>Game Parameters 
        Discussed</B><BR>-------------------------<BR><BR>Before you begin to 
        design a race, or to adapt a design you already have, you should sit 
        down and think about the game you are going to enter. Naturally, the 
        game parameters and special rules can (and should) influence your 
        design. Probably the most basic decision is: should one play an AR at 
        all? If so, what sort of AR? Following is a list of universe parameters 
        and special rules, with discussion of how they affect the AR.<BR><BR>** 
        Universe Size and Crowding: ARs do best in uncrowded circumstances. Of 
        course, every race can do better with more planets to work with, by 
        scouting actively and "cherry picking" -- colonizing the best planets 
        first. But in addition to this effect, as previously mentioned ARs 
        increase their resource totals by simply spreading out. Finding four 
        100% planets does not immediately help a normal race; an AR can benefit 
        as soon as he can a colonizer there. A second aspect of larger galaxies 
        is that the more planets there are per player on average, the more 
        likely tech is to go to the maximum before serious conflict starts. ARs 
        benefit more from max tech than other races, since it means they should 
        have high energy for resources, and death stars for growing 
        pop.<BR><BR>The less crowded an AR is, the narrower he can make his hab. 
        In the extreme, an AR can be a one-immune with both other fields of 
        minimum width, for about 1/21 initial greens. Barry Kearn's "ARvids" is 
        of this ilk; it was the first public AR "monster" race. Such a race can 
        afford very high %grow, 1/10 pop efficiency, and good tech. In a very 
        uncrowded place (such as an unopposed small packed testbed), the race 
        monsters easily. However, in any reasonably constrained area, such as a 
        tiny normal, the ARvids flop. I call the artificial sense of security 
        people get from testbedding in absurdly large places with narrow hab 
        races "the ARvid effect".<BR><BR>One more point to add about choosing to 
        play in uncrowded games: although uncrowded places are good for AR and 
        help them relative to most other races, there is one PRT that benefits 
        even more than ARs: CAs, especially narrow-hab TT CAs. So, if CAs are 
        banned in an uncrowded game, that is the best possible situation for an 
        AR.<BR><BR>** Game Definition: some of these would certainly affect my 
        decision to play an AR. Let's look at them.<BR><BR>Max Minerals: good 
        for factory based races. Hurts ARs, though, since their main ace in the 
        hole -- the infinite minerals, eventually -- is much less competitive 
        the more "normal" minerals everyone else gets.<BR><BR>AccBBS: good for 
        hypergrowth races. Hurts ARs, since with the square root aspect of 
        resource generation, starting with 25000 pop does not hurt their 
        production that greatly.<BR><BR>Slow Tech: puts a premium on resources, 
        thus, hurts ARs. Depending on the galaxy size, may make it completely 
        impractical to play AR.<BR><BR>Galaxy Clumping: little effect.<BR><BR>No 
        Random Events: helps ARs, slightly, since it means nobody will be 
        getting the Alien Miner or Genesis Device, and thereby partly or 
        completely nullifying your late-game mineral advantage. The existence of 
        other MT parts in the game is also probably bad for ARs, as many of the 
        parts tend to make BBs much better fighting ships, whereas AR tend to 
        have cheap con and therefore will often be the first to get nubians. 
        Also, ARs often have very few spare minerals until the early BB era, 
        later than other players, so will often miss the first few 
        MTs.<BR><BR>Public Player Scores: generally, hurts ARs. People already 
        know you are weak, but because they cannot count your pop, they don't 
        really know how weak. Without knowing where your economy is, they cannot 
        know your tech. Thus, you have the diplomatic flexibility to lie a 
        little bit. Public player scores takes the guesswork out: your neighbor 
        will know exactly what your tech is, and what your econ is, and how many 
        ships you have.<BR><BR><BR>** Special Game Rules:<BR><BR>Team games: ARs 
        are nice to have in team games, since with teammates you have built-in 
        trustworthy trading partners; you offer minerals and can get tech and 
        protection.<BR><BR>Jump games: sometimes hosts do games in which there 
        is an initial "jump" of 500 to 1000 years where players can do tech but 
        not interact. You must examine these very carefully. If you can enter 
        one of these games and end up after the jump on equal footing, AR would 
        be a very strong race to play. Typically, the mineral shortage won't 
        happen for a while, but on the other hand the AR ability to grow *fast* 
        and cheap will put you in good stead. However, in my experience most of 
        these games are dreamed up without considering ARs, and thus have no 
        special rules for them. And given that ARs only generate about one half 
        the resources of a normal factory race, playing an AR would be suicidal. 
        So, be very careful about playing a jump game with AR: ask yourself: if 
        I were a IT, what could I do with this setup? (The reason for IT, is 
        that by starting with two planets you can rather easily get twice the 
        resources of any non-IT or PP.) You should also consider what a 
        narrow-hab TT CA might do in the setup.<BR><BR><BR><BR><B>Race 
        Design</B><BR>-----------<BR><BR>** LRTs<BR><BR>*** ISB: Almost 
        mandatory. Very low %grow ARs may avoid it.<BR><BR>You get two things 
        from ISB, both handy. First, the space dock. These allow you a very 
        cheap way to have up to 125000 pop on a planet with full growth. They 
        also give fuel, can build ships, etc., as they do for normal 
        races.<BR><BR>The main reason for taking ISB is ultrastations. Con 12 
        costs around 13000 resources with cheap con; thus it can be obtained 
        fairly early by almost any AR. Con 17 costs around 70000 resources 
        (again with cheap con); this amount is fairly hard to obtain by most ARs 
        before severe crowding sets in.<BR><BR><BR><BR>*** IFE: Recommended. 
        Very wide hab ARs may be able to get away without it. <BR><BR>Generally, 
        ARs will want IFE more than normal races. Unlike a normal race, ARs need 
        to be moving as soon as possible. It is true that ARs have resources to 
        spend, but they need every iota invested into growth: energy, con, and 
        terraforming. You need at *least* prop 5 to move far without IFE, and 
        even that is pretty slow.<BR><BR>On the other hand, in denser universes 
        with ARs that have very wide hab and low growth, there should be enough 
        planets very close by so that the early engines are acceptable for the 
        initial colonization.<BR><BR>If you do not take IFE, then taking prop 
        cheap or at least normal is a good idea.<BR><BR><BR>*** CE: sometimes. 
        Yucky for any race.<BR><BR>CE sucks at all times, but of all the races 
        to take it with, AR would have to be among the most likely, second after 
        IT. Several reasons. First, taking CE means you can start at prop 2 for 
        mizers. For other races, not a big deal, but AR want to be moving 
        immediately, not even spending a small amount on prop. Second, early on 
        with AR, you are on the defensive. Building gateable horde style ships 
        as specific countermeasures to enemy designs can be quite useful. CE is 
        never as bad on defense as on offense.<BR><BR>CE is bad once you get 
        later in the game, though, so avoid it in larger places, team games, or 
        other places where you have good reason to think you will survive 
        later.<BR><BR>And of course, if you are like me you would rather lose 
        than play the game with the micromanagement induced by CE, and never 
        ever take it. :) But this is not how some people feel. The points are 
        pretty good.<BR><BR><BR>*** NRSE: rarely. Better in larger 
        places.<BR><BR>The downside of NRSE is, obviously, losing the ram 
        engines other than the fuel mizer. Generally, rams are cheaper than 
        normal engines in resources, which makes ARs like them more than others. 
        Also, rams cost more G than other engines, meaning that ARs, needing no 
        G for factories, can afford them better than most races.<BR><BR>The 
        upside of NRSE is mainly the points. ARs don't have that many places to 
        scrape up advantage points.<BR><BR>Secondarily, NRSE provides the 
        interspace-10 (the earliest warp 10 engine). However, it is very 
        expensive, and you won't have the resources or the minerals to really 
        exploit it. Furthermore, as an AR you don't plan to be on the attack in 
        the midgame, and warp 10 is much less useful for defense than attack. If 
        I took CE, I would feel a lot better about NRSE. And of course, I would 
        always want IFE for the mizer, but it is practically mandatory with 
        NRSE.<BR><BR>Thus, I would recommend either IFE/CE/NRSE, or just 
        IFE.<BR><BR><BR>*** TT: sometimes. Recommended for 1/25 ARs.<BR><BR>TT 
        is a very nice thing for an AR to have, because of the way terraforming 
        works in the resources equation. That is, that the value of a planet 
        directly produces resources, unlike normal races. Thus, terraforming is 
        a straight investment for ARs, in addition to a means of increasing the 
        rate of growth. As with any investment, making it cheaper is good. 
        Consider an average green for a one-immune: it might start at 50% hab 
        with each point of terraforming increasing the value by 3%, say. Let's 
        say there is enough pop there to produce 100 resources/turn. Spending 
        that 100, you could increase the planet to 53% and thus the resources to 
        106. Without TT, the rate of return from the terraforming is 6%: not 
        great. With TT, the rate is better: 8.6%. By comparison, normal races 
        invest in factories. A typical 12/9/x race gets 13.3%, given 
        G.<BR><BR>TT also helps the AR work up yellows. Yellow colonization is 
        typically much more important for ARs than other races, since they are 
        so desperate for resources.<BR><BR>With all that good stuff to say about 
        TT, why only "sometimes" take it? Because it is very expensive. I 
        recommend TT more readily to 1/25 ARs in part because they have fewer 
        resources from pop, but also because they have the extra points to 
        invest.<BR><BR>Also, unlike normal races ARs have a hard time taking 
        cheap bio, because they need cheap energy and con (everyone needs cheap 
        weapons). Thus, the higher levels of TT will be out of reach of the AR 
        until the very late game.<BR><BR><BR>*** LSP: OK for high growth ARs, 
        though they should consider dropping %grow instead. Not good for low 
        growth ARs.<BR><BR>Some people swear by LSP for ARs, because the square 
        root effect: you lose 30% of the pop, but it is only 17% of the 
        resources. But the fact remains that you are two years back of where you 
        would otherwise be, or three for a midgrowth (13%) AR. This means there 
        are planets that you might have gotten, but will not, because you will 
        be too late. Is it worth it? As always, maybe. In a less crowded galaxy, 
        LSP (and high growth) seems like the right way to go. If you lose one 
        planet out of 50, it only reduces your econ by 2%. You may well be able 
        to buy 2% more econ with the points, perhaps with a wider hab. On the 
        other hand, if you are only getting 10 planets, then losing a planet is 
        10% of your econ, and you will probably want to think twice about LSP. 
        Remember your grand strategy: get out of the gate quickly, grab space 
        and hold it.<BR><BR><BR>*** OBRM: never.<BR><BR>The one mining module 
        you get with OBRM is initially the equivalent of about "mines cost 40", 
        if that were possible. With full miniaturization, at con 21/elec 20, the 
        OBRM miner is about like "mines cost 10". At the midlevels where you 
        have to be starting to buy miners, it is about mines cost 20. All of 
        those are way, way too much.<BR><BR><BR>*** ARM: Often. Good for any AR, 
        but not necessary.<BR><BR>ARM provides several things beyond what you 
        get with "normal" mining (neither ARM nor OBRM). First, you get the two 
        potato bugs to start with. These are nice, but not necessary except 
        perhaps for very low growth ARs. You also get the ultraminer hull, which 
        is the cheapest way to buy mines, but not gateable. And there is the 
        miner hull. Not amazingly useful.<BR><BR>The main thing you get with ARM 
        is superbugs: the midget miner hull and the ultra miners. Superbugs are 
        gateable, and very cheap.<BR><BR>Having miners be gateable has three 
        benefits. First, you get the minerals in places other than the 
        homeworld. The minerals at home are cheap, but the planet will quickly 
        drop to its 30 min con. And so at many places the minerals will be even 
        cheaper. It also costs to distribute the minerals out from the 
        homeworld; you must buy freighters or packets.<BR><BR>Second, gateable 
        miners allow you build them anywhere, then gate them home to mine. This 
        means you can increase your mining very quickly, if need be, by having 
        all planets build miners.<BR><BR>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, 
        is the fact that *other* players can use the minerals in your planets 
        quite nicely. They just have to kick you off of the planets. Thus, one 
        aspect of the gateable superbugs is defensive: to quickly drain out any 
        new planet, so as to deny the minerals to enemies or would-be enemies. I 
        would advocate leaving a fleet or two of superbugs on every planet until 
        it is considerably below 30 con, for this reason.<BR><BR><BR>*** NAS: 
        often.<BR><BR>NAS is a good point mine. Not having penscans is not as 
        great a problem on defense, and the doubled range can be helpful. That 
        said, penscans are a great benefit to any race, and you should always 
        think twice before giving them up. For ARs the choice is perhaps a 
        little harder than most, since they need allies and friends in the 
        midgame, and trading penscans is one very helpful way to keep friends 
        friendly.<BR><BR><BR>*** RS: sometimes.<BR><BR>This LRT is nice to have 
        in the very early game, and in the nubian era, but weak in between. This 
        is about the same zone as where ARs are weak, so they should avoid RS if 
        the midgame is likely to be long. But, if the midgame is likely to be 
        long, ARs should probably avoid the entire game. That is, if you are 
        considering AR at all, this may be a good LRT.<BR><BR>RS will mean you 
        cannot effectively armor your stations, so if you like huge deathstars 
        it may not be for you. It works well, though, with the late game 
        Mao-style war that ARs excel at.<BR><BR>RS also makes it a bad idea to 
        armor your ships. This is not necessarily a bad thing, just different; 
        it means you will be building twice as many BBs to get the same armor. 
        On the plus side, you get twice as many shields and they are up 40%, so 
        your shield/armor balance will be great. (Normal BBs tend to have much 
        less shielding than armor, making them fairly good targets for capital 
        ship missiles.) On the minus side, you effectively pay twice as much for 
        for the engines and electronics on the BB; thus, if you are thinking 
        about NRSE you should probably avoid RS.<BR><BR><BR>*** GR: never. You 
        need energy and con fast, not the others. Going at 65% speed is going to 
        hurt ARs more than any other race.<BR><BR><BR>*** BET: never. You have 
        cheap con. Don't waste the opportunity to be the first to nubians by 
        making them double price forever.<BR><BR><BR>*** MA: never never never. 
        Obviously, just build more remote miners.<BR><BR><BR>*** UR: rarely. The 
        main problem with Ultimate Recycling is that it is quite costly, and ARs 
        tend not to have points to spend. Also, the big advantage to UR happens 
        when you get to nubians, since it allows a race to win the counterdesign 
        wars. But if AR can make it to nubians, he is already is a very good 
        position. Getting there is the problem, not winning once there. Finally, 
        using UR can be fussy at best, and it is usually possible to avoid 
        building designs that won't last.<BR><BR><BR>** Hab and 
        Growth<BR><BR>There are two conflicting imperatives to keep in mind for 
        AR habitat. On the one hand, because of spreading and in general the low 
        resources an AR gets per planet, he wants all the planets he can get. 
        This argues for wide hab variables, which means centered habs or 
        immunities. On the other hand, ARs want the diplomatic advantages of 
        intersettlement, an argument against centered habs. This is one reason 
        immunities work well for ARs: they are wide without being 
        centered.<BR><BR>The following sections discuss various AR hab/growth 
        strategies. They are discussed in order of how strong they are, IMO, 
        with the stronger hab schemes coming first.<BR><BR><BR>*** Single Immune 
        ARs<BR><BR>Arguably the best AR hab, for general use, is one immunity, 
        one relatively wide variable, and one narrow and offset. %Grow from 13% 
        up to 17% or so; the higher values will require narrow 
        habs.<BR><BR>Typically, it is done as immune grav, wide rad, and narrow 
        offset energy. This works with other standard AR choices. Immune grav 
        means prop research for terraforming is not needed; IFE, expensive prop, 
        and sometimes NRSE/CE build on this. ARs, like anyone else, need 
        weapons, so you are going to get the rad terraforming in any case. And 
        ARs tend to go high into energy fast; it is not uncommon to get energy 
        10 by 2415. A slight variant of this scheme uses immune grav, wide 
        centered temp, and narrow offset rad.<BR><BR>A second one-immune scheme 
        is wide grav, rad immune, and narrow offset temp. This has one 
        disadvantage over the previous scheme: it requires at least some prop 
        research, and it "wastes" weapons research. But the problem is less 
        important than it seems: because the temp is much narrower than grav, it 
        is going to be the preferred field for terraforming anyway. Offsetting 
        this disadvantage is the advantage gained from rad immunity: it raises 
        your overall universal hab slightly more than either of the other two 
        immunities would, because the distribution of rad is less centered than 
        grav/temp.<BR><BR>1/25 pop efficiency can work well with one-immunes. In 
        this case, I would recommend spending the points on hab and TT. The 
        reason for hab is obvious: you are giving up 36% of your economy; the 
        only way to get it back is to get more planets and/or better planets. 
        So, widen the hab to get more. The reason for TT is less obvious: in 
        shrinking each planet but taking more of them, you have increased the 
        amount of the economy that will be spend on terraforming. This slows the 
        race down, so that even if you widened the hab enough to get 36% more 
        planets, you are still much slower. Thus, it is still a reasonable idea 
        to take expensive bio and TT with such a race.<BR><BR><BR>*** Non immune 
        ARs<BR><BR>Generally, the non immune AR is a less aggressive, more HPish 
        style of play than the one-immune. By not spending on the immunity, you 
        are getting points to put into two wide hab variables and one mid-width 
        one. Thus you will end up, in the long run, with more planets. The 
        downside is that in the early going, you have more low-value greens, 
        yellows and near reds which are not producing much.<BR><BR>Non immune 
        ARs should consider TT for the higher terraforming levels, not just the 
        cheap terraforming. If they do take TT, they should consider cheap or 
        normal bio.<BR><BR>Given that weapons and energy are the two most 
        important fields for any AR, a non immune AR will want to have either 
        temp or rad be the narrowest hab variable, or both equally wide. Grav, 
        therefore, should be wide, no narrower than 15 clicks in from the edge. 
        Wider is OK; this increases hab values; IMO even full width is OK. 
        Generally, I like to take rad as the narrowest field, because it can be 
        most successfully offset.<BR><BR>I do not recommend 1/25 efficiency for 
        non-immune ARs. Generally, they should find it hard to widen their hab 
        by 36% without taking an immunity.<BR><BR>TT is recommended for 
        non-immune ARs. Compared to a one-immune, they are going to have 50% 
        more terraforming expense (three fields to work on instead of two), and 
        they will have to get it somehow using all those small 
        planets.<BR><BR><BR>*** Bi-immune ARs<BR><BR>Bi-immune ARs are, IMO, 
        borderline playable. Some of them can reach almost the resources totals 
        of one-immunes. The typical bi-immune AR has growth 13%, 1/25 pop 
        efficiency, and immune in grav and rad, with temp the narrowest possible 
        and offset only somewhat. This gives 23% green initially; with 15 points 
        of terraforming, 56% of planets are green and all of them will be at 
        least 41%. A second hab scheme is to take grav and temp immune, rad 
        narrow and offset, typically 12 points in from one edge or the other. 
        This gives slightly fewer greens, but by being more strongly offset it 
        has a better chance of successful intersettlement and noncompetition 
        with monsters.<BR><BR>The HP version of bi-immunes is to take 9% growth 
        with 1/10 efficiency. This race has better long term production, but it 
        ramps up quite slowly.<BR><BR>TT is optional for any biimmune. With two 
        immunities, the amount of terraforming you need to do is quite 
        reduced.<BR><BR><BR>*** The AR triimmune<BR><BR>The triimmune AR is not 
        really viable for high level play. However, it is certainly an idea to 
        keep in mind for team games, or other games with special rules. 
        Generally, the triimmune is 6%, 1/8 pop efficiency. Variants are 
        possible, of course. 7% is possible, for instance, though the points 
        required are considerable, resulting in a race with weak LRTs.<BR><BR>No 
        triimmune should ever have worse pop efficiency than 1/10.<BR><BR><BR>** 
        Coefficient<BR><BR>As with normal races, it is typical to only consider 
        1/10 or 1/25 for an AR. The reason is similar: consider the drop from 
        1/10 to 1/11. Here, you are sacrificing roughly 5% of your economy for 
        50 points. Now consider the drop from 1/24 to 1/25. Here, the same 50 
        points means losing only about 2% of your economy. 1/9 gains you 5%, but 
        for *200* points. ARs are desperate for resources, but usually not 
        *that* desperate.<BR><BR>For most players, and certainly beginners, I 
        would recommend the 1/10 AR. Compared to the 1/25 AR, it has fewer, 
        better planets. That's generally easier to run in MM terms. It is also 
        easier to take a more offset hab, when needing fewer planets. A typical 
        1/10 AR will use perhaps 60% of planets with full terraforming. This 
        gives diplomatic advantages, which any AR needs.<BR><BR>1/25 ARs are 
        viable, though. They tend to need better play, though, because of their 
        need for many more planets: with full terraforming, a 1/25 AR will use 
        essentially all planets. <BR><BR><BR>** Research<BR><BR>Tech is more 
        important for ARs than ordinary races, since they need at least some 
        energy to get resources, and con to get the advanced space stations. 
        Like other races, they need weapons for defense. Therefore, the 
        traditional AR takes good tech -- cheap energy, weapons, and con. Two or 
        three of the others expensive; sometimes normal prop or 
        elect.<BR><BR>That said, ARs are also fairly desperate for advantage 
        points from any source, in order to get the growth, hab, LRTs, etc. that 
        they will need to survive. Thus, sometimes players want to mine the tech 
        for points.<BR><BR><BR><B>Playing ARs</B><BR>-----------<BR><BR>For the 
        AR, the game may be broadly broken down into three main sections: the 
        early, mid, and late games. These correspond to the AR's situation 
        vis-a-vis other players. In the early game, the AR is expanding outward 
        into unoccupied space. In the midgame, the AR tries to build upward, 
        getting energy tech and con to increase his planet's sizes. Finally, in 
        the late game the AR goes on the offense, using his mineral advantage 
        achieve victory.<BR><BR>** Early game: Tech Strategy<BR><BR>This is a 
        sketch of how I play ARs. First, a general idea of what you should be 
        doing in terms of tech. Here is the basic sequence of what techs you 
        want to get, in what order.<BR><BR>start<BR>energy to 4+, higher is 
        better...<BR>[homeworld getting close to 250K]<BR>con to 3, prop to 2 
        (if IFE), else 5 (if not IFE).<BR>[medium freighter pop mover now 
        possible]<BR>more energy...<BR>[first colony getting near to 62500 
        colonists]<BR>con to 4, for dock<BR>energy to 10<BR>cheap terraforming 
        tech (weaps/prop 5 if you aren't immune in<BR>rad/grav)<BR>con to 12, 
        for ultrastations<BR>bio 4 (for minelayers)<BR>energy to 11-14<BR>con to 
        17, for deathstars<BR>elect to 8 for ultraminer<BR>energy to 
        16<BR><BR>That's the basics. Of course you need to get low bio levels in 
        there (for terraform techs), but don't do them until you have at least 
        one colony that will actually use the tech. Another thing to keep in 
        mind is the sequence above is only the *economic* part of your tech 
        game. You may well be doing other tech within that sequence for reasons 
        of defense, mainly weapons but also electronics and even prop. For 
        instance, depending on the pressure from other races you may want to get 
        weapons 16 before death stars.<BR><BR>Regarding the very early 
        production, generally you will do fine building only scouts and colony 
        ships before you get con 3. The scouts are there to find good planets, 
        the colony ships to get a toehold. Many AR players don't start 
        colonizing until they get their home planet to 250000, but that is a 
        mistake. You should colonize any green, and even some yellows, well 
        before then. Remember the square root effect: your most efficient 
        colonists are the first few. However, don't send more pop (just the 2200 
        in a colony ship), until the home planet is nearing 250000, unless the 
        planet is in the high 90's.<BR><BR>With a very low growth race (9% or 
        less), I sometimes build one or two "minitrucks" -- small freighters 
        with FM and fuel pod; they only move 7000 pop, but that is enough to 
        double the production of a colony with 2200 pop... minitrucks are 
        typically not needed with high growth rate races, though, since they 
        will get to 250K fast enough. For a triimmune AR, you never want to move 
        more than 2200 pop per fleet until the midgame, and so you can make a 
        slightly better minitruck by using the colony ship hull.<BR><BR>Once you 
        get near 250000 pop at the HW, get con 3. Then you can start building 2 
        or 3 medium-freighter "trucks" each turn, until you have enough out to 
        continually carry off all pop above 250000 on the HW. The "standard" 
        medium truck is a medium freighter hull, a mizer, and a fuel pod. It can 
        just get 162 ly at warp 9 and return empty, or 192 ly at warp 8; beyond 
        192 ly you need to add fuel somehow. Building docks in strategic places 
        can be very useful in this regard, since they provide gas. For more 
        distant planets, you will have to augment trucks with fuel-pod scouts, 
        that is, a scout with just FM and a fuel pod. These are quite cheap, and 
        will allow you to do warp-8 or 9 runs to any distance and back, if you 
        add enough. Some players use fuel DDs instead of scouts; they are a bit 
        more expensive but can be armed, which may be very 
        helpful.<BR><BR>Unlike normal races, you should spread your pop exports. 
        Generally, I try to use them to keep all planets at the same pop level, 
        excepting an extra load or two early to high value planets.<BR><BR><BR>* 
        Mid game and later game considerations<BR><BR>After the early game, 
        there is no cookie-cutter prescription for what to do as AR. The 
        situations will vary far too much for that.<BR><BR>Probably the best 
        situation for you (that is likely, anyway) would be to be part of an 
        alliance against a distant leader, one of a group of more or less peers. 
        Your allies need you too much for them to turn on you or let you be 
        killed, allowing you to get through to the late game where your minerals 
        will dominate. In this case, you need to play a very machiavellian game. 
        Let the enemy pound your allies if they are starting to become dominant; 
        keep the balance of power stable. If the situation becomes unstable 
        (i.e. your alliance beats the enemy and takes their space), then your 
        alliance will fracture, and you don't want that to happen until you are 
        ready.<BR><BR>A more likely scenario would be that you are on the front 
        line versus the enemy. Your allies do want you alive, just small enough 
        that their resources are the ones that turn your minerals into a win -- 
        for them. This situation must be played very carefully, giving your 
        allies minerals but driving a hard bargain in terms of getting tech and 
        planets from them. Generally it will be easier to get tech, especially 
        the less useful techs (prop and elect), so concentrate on that. Remember 
        that to you, resources are precious, much more than to them.<BR><BR>The 
        midgame is the most dangerous era for an AR. This is the period others 
        have many more resources than you, and have caught up with your earlier 
        tech lead (at least in weapons, and maybe other fields). They can 
        therefore field more ships than you can.<BR><BR>Packing planets -- 
        similar to the case of normal races, ARs should first pack out very low 
        value greens. However, it is for different reasons; normal races should 
        always pack their high value planets last because of their pop growth 
        rule. ARs pack out &lt;25% greens because of the minimum value on hab 
        for the purposes of resource generation. Unlike a normal race, it does 
        not matter how you pack higher value planets (&gt;=25% greens, that is) 
        with an AR; from low to high value planets or from high to low. Just do 
        what is convenient in terms of where the planets and minerals 
        are.<BR><BR>Reds -- ARs use reds better than most other races, so grab 
        any free planet you can get. Bring four large freighters of pop, if 
        possible, and build a dock in the first turn. Then queue a death star 
        with a 300/500 gate (use a dock if you don't expect to keep the planet 
        long), and forget about the planet for a while. When the base completes, 
        find a free fleet of superbugs and gate it over to mine the planet out 
        as fast as possible.<BR><BR>Tech Trading -- You should always trade tech 
        if you can, be you AR or not. Most non-AR races will take cheap weapons 
        and other tech expensive, so you can very frequently trade energy and/or 
        con for weapons. Even races with good tech will rarely have superior 
        energy to yours, so you can almost always trade energy for 
        something.<BR><BR><BR>* Warfare<BR><BR>Late in the game, with an AR, you 
        can expect a time to come when you can outproduce the rest of the galaxy 
        combined, since they have no minerals left and you do. Even once this 
        happens, you still may be in danger -- they have their fleets in being, 
        and may be able to stomp you before you can build up enough to match 
        theirs. But beyond point, the game will be more or less won. You just 
        need to mop up.<BR><BR>I am not discussing this part of the game much, 
        because the warfare is much like the standard Stars war. "Mahan" style, 
        you take your massive fleet and go to the enemy, destroying his planets 
        until he is desperate enough to commit his fleet, or until you have so 
        much force that you can beat his fleet even spread out.<BR><BR>What I am 
        more interested in, is the style of warfare before this point in the 
        game is reached. That is, for an AR that has made it into the midgame. 
        Your tech might be 18/20/12/17/12/9 or so. You have starting making 
        superbugs in many places and have minerals to spend, but so do your 
        enemies. People are starting to make noise with BBs.<BR><BR>ARs are, by 
        their nature, factoryless. They grow pop better than any other PRT. They 
        use reds well, and should typically be designed so that with high 
        terraforming tech, between 50% and 100% of planets will be yellow or 
        green. Furthermore, until the very late game when their mineral edge 
        finally becomes dominant, they will always have fewer resources/lower 
        tech/fewer ships than normal races. This means they fight at a 
        disadvantage, typically, in terms of fleet size, though they can hope to 
        be part of an alliance so that combined fleets are more or less 
        balanced. But that does not always happen.<BR><BR>All of these things 
        point at one style of operational warfare for the AR: a spread out war 
        on the map, denying the decisive battle to the enemy while fighting him 
        in a population/resource war. This strategy of warfare has been dubbed 
        the "Mao" strategy by Jason Cawley, in a excellent article on it that 
        can be found on the net (search google for "Epworthian"), and in a 
        modified form in the official strategy guide.<BR><BR>(The funny thing 
        about this article, is that it is really fairly useless for most races 
        in planning strategy. Most races rely on factories for the majority or 
        vast majority of their resource production; for these races, factory 
        sites need to be defended. Cawley's race in the article in question 
        happened to be perfect for a Mao strategy, which is why he did it. But 
        it is not something you will get to do every day in stars, unless you 
        play factoryless races including ARs.)<BR><BR>Rather than repeat 
        everything that Cawley says in his article, I suggest that you find it 
        and read it now. Go on. And now, I will merely comment on some 
        differences between how the AR fights a Mao style war, and what Cawley 
        did with the Saxons.<BR><BR>First, the Saxons had a big advantage that 
        ARs don't have: they did not die with their battlestation. So, the 
        Epworthians had to bring lots of bombers, and even then had to spend a 
        lot of time bombing. This slowed their attack. And it allowed 
        bomber-killing kamikazi actions against the bombers, by the Saxons and 
        his ally.<BR><BR>As an AR, you should expect to lose planets to a 
        superior enemy very quickly. The enemy should be able to kill at least 
        one planet per turn, and probably more if he guesses well, sweeps 
        aggressively, and is willing to take losses. Therefore, you need to be 
        able to colonize at least two planets a turn, to make up for your 
        losses. However, you can do that. Keep a reserve of one or two colony 
        ships at each planet. And keep a few large freighters at each planet 
        near the front.<BR><BR>Whenever the enemy looks like he might destroy 
        one of your starbases, take inventory of the local situation. First, 
        determine if you are likely to win the battle. If not, the freighters 
        should be used to remove any minerals, especially germanium, from the 
        planet, and population after that. Deny germ to the enemy especially, 
        and he will have a hard time consolidating his advances.<BR><BR>If you 
        are going to win a battle, but lose the starbase (i.e. the enemy is 
        sending in kamikazis to kill bases), then you should gather all the pop 
        possible into the local freighters but don't move them. Order a colony 
        ship to the planet from a nearby planet (so that you get waypoint 1 
        colonization). If the enemy does not attack, you lose little, just that 
        turn's resources from the pop you lifted. If he does attack and kills 
        the starbase, then *after* combat, the colonizer coming in will put up a 
        new orbital fort. You can then load up to 500000 pop on it, and queue 
        for the first build a space dock. The next turn, you can put on whatever 
        more pop you can arrange to have there, up to 3M, and queue a death 
        star.<BR><BR>Don't be too concerned with losing population, with most 
        ARs (low growth ARs, though, should give more thought to saving pop). 
        Because of the square root effect, and AR can afford to strip off half 
        the pop from all of his planets if he needs it for 
        recolonization.<BR><BR>One point to note about Mao-style wars with AR: 
        unlike the Saxons, who were truly decentralized, an AR *does* have a 
        central point that is vulnerable: his home planet. And the mining fleets 
        themselves may be vulnerable, especially for a non-ARM AR. (This is yet 
        another reason that superbugs are great.) So it is generally a good idea 
        to play in places large enough that homeworlds are not packed together. 
        But note that until the very late game, you don't have to hold your 
        homeworld; it is nice but not necessary, because there should still be 
        plenty of minerals in remote places.<BR><BR>There is an upside to the 
        "mine vulnerability" gap, though. And that is that a race like the 
        Saxons *does* have the problem of reestablishing mines on planets that 
        get bombed out, when it retakes them. Losing 1000 mines costs 3000 
        resources. In this sense, an AR (especially with ARM) is again a sort of 
        super factoryless Maoist: more vulnerable, but also faster to 
        recover.<BR><BR>On the other side of the coin, your offensive 
        operations. Your goal here is threefold: to pull the enemy fleet away 
        from killing your planets; to destroy factories; and to gain space for 
        yourself. All of these will be accomplished in the normal mode of 
        attacking. Let's look at that.<BR><BR>First off, to attack you need at 
        least a bit of battle strength. But it does not really take that much. A 
        bunch of light and cheap mine sweeper DDs. Just enough of a warfleet to 
        take an orbit, and enough bombs to kill a planet in a turn or three. As 
        is always the case in these things, the exterior circumstances matter a 
        lot. Does he have penscans? If not, things are easier for you. Does he 
        have light forces present? Mines? Etc.<BR><BR>Your general idea, on the 
        attack, will be to take risks with small forces to try to knock down 
        bases so you can bomb. Your bombs, even against good defenses, cost him 
        serious resources, and germanium. Once you get the defenses lowered, you 
        get to add population to the list of things endangered.<BR><BR>For 
        instance, consider a light force with enough cherry bombs to destroy an 
        undefended planet in a turn: that would be 40 cherries. That would also 
        destroy 400 installations on an undefended planet. Against maximum 
        planetary shield defenses, it destroys 210 installations. For an average 
        sort of planet, with maybe 500000 pop and 12/9/16(checked) factories and 
        10/3/16 mines, that would be on the order of 90 factories and mines, and 
        11 defenses destroyed. The total cost to the enemy: whatever the 
        starbase cost, plus 1245 resources, plus 55/55/325 iron/boron/germ. So 
        you see, if you capture orbits, you *can* hurt the enemy quite a bit, 
        without needing to take the planet or even be in orbit for more than a 
        turn. However, to win you have to be hurting the enemy faster and more 
        than he hurts you.<BR><BR>It is much better for you, if you can arrange 
        things to keep orbits captured for long enough to bomb out the enemy. 
        (Of course that is not always possible.) Unlike other races, you have no 
        interest at all in leaving any installations standing on the planet; 
        they can only help the enemy. So, if you decide to go with B-52 bombers, 
        or two designs, then going with LBUs as your main skirmishing bomber is 
        a good idea.<BR><BR>In a larger galaxy, I would recommend using 
        minibombers with LBU-45s as your main bomber, supported by B-52s with 
        cherries to finish off planets with your main fleet, when it attacks. 
        The LBUs can skirmish nicely; they are cheap, they kill lots of 
        installations, and they can be gated about quickly. Spread them out into 
        enemy space with light forces, and force the enemy to concentrate there. 
        If he is putting forces there, they are not in your space killing your 
        planets.<BR><BR>In smaller places, just use a B-52 design with mostly 
        LBUs and one slot of cherries. 7 of them together is sufficient to kill 
        an undefended planet, but should inflict serious economic hurt on the 
        enemy even against full defenses.<BR><BR>One final difference between an 
        AR and other races, even factoryless normal races, on the attack. An AR 
        can very sensibly bring population with him on the attack, and gain 
        ground there. Normal races have to bring a substantial amount of 
        population to a planet to have much effect; i.e. assume you drop 55000 
        Saxons on a planet in enemy space. Well, they can put up a dock, 
        perhaps, and turn whatever enemy minerals are left (probably little G to 
        use) to make light ships. But they only have 55 resources per turn, 
        initially, to do it with.<BR><BR>Contrast that with bringing 55000 AR 
        civvies to the same planet. With energy 18, they would get 314 resources 
        if the planet was 100%, or as little as 78 if the planet is red or low 
        value green. With even fewer civvies at risk, the AR has an even greater 
        advantage (i.e., with 10000 pop the Saxons get 10 resources; an AR gets 
        33-134).<BR><BR>Only if the enemy has no bombers or packet launchers 
        around, should a normal race put hundreds of thousands of pop at risk in 
        enemy space. AR can, and should, make much better use of this potential. 
        Every planet withing 81 ly of one of yours that is empty, you should 
        have your eye on to colonize. Send over a colony ship, and a large 
        freighter with 100000 pop and some minerals. (If the enemy has no 
        range-3 beamers with battle speed 2.25+, you can use galleons with 
        overthrusters.) If you get the colony there, great, build a dock (they 
        are very, very cheap), and build light ships until threatened enough 
        that you have to run away.<BR><BR></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
