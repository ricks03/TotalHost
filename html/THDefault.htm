<h2>Rick's Default Game Setup</h2>

<P>Small Standard Dense Universe, Slow Tech, Accelerated BBS, No Public Scores. Turn generation will be 1 year, 1 year, 2 years, 2 years, *****repeat 2 year generations**** until Year 30. Turns generated after Year 30 will be in 1 year increments.

<P>Turns generated MWF. Turns due in (received) by 9:00 PM. Players are granted 2 <Delay> vouchers, each good to delay 1 turn of generation. They renew when the total left < [the number specified]. Vouchers can be used w/o creating an actual delay.

<P>Once the game starts, all communication is to be within the game messaging system. This includes outside the game "hypothetical" and "theoretical" discussions with allies which could grant strategic advantage. Please  play within that spirit. One example would be that players are not to pass Stars! output files (such as .pla files). No preformed alliances. You may ally with who you wish, but only one player can win.

<ul>
<li>No stealing pop as Stealth (fixed in JRC4)</li>
<li>No making use of the minefield "free passage" bugs (fixed in JRC4)</li>
<li>No making use of "free starbase" bug.</li>
<li>No weapons construction with Weapons 5+ is allowed until all lower weapons tech is scrapped, never to be used again (Chaff balancing).</li>
</ul>

<P>Victory Conditions: Agreed-upon Control of > 50% of the HWs.

<P>50 pt. starting race penalty for everyone (meaning you must have this many points left over in the race wizard)

<P>Additionally:
<ul>
<li>No CA</li>
<li>JoaT can only take No Advanced Scanners if they also take an additional  95 pt penalty.</li>
<li>Interstellar Traveller additional 50 pt penalty</li>
<li>Alternate Reality additional 50 pt bonus</li>
<li>HE additional 25 pt bonus</li>
<li>Packet Physics additional 25 pt bonus</li>
<li>Space Demolition additional 0 pt penalty</li>
<li>Jack of All Trades additional 25 pt penalty</li>
<li>Inner Strength additional 25 pt penalty</li>
</ul>

<P>Additionally:
<ul>
<li>Intermediate player -- addtl. 50 point penalty</li>
<li>Advanced player -- addtl. 75 point penalty</li>
<li>Expert Player -- addtl. 100 point penalty</li>
</ul>

<P>Example: An Intermediate player selecting JoaT with NAS would be required to have: 50(base) + 95(NAS) + 25(Joat) + 50 (Intermediate) = 220 points left over in the race wizard.

<P>Playing Instructions:
<P>For  those who don't know the drill, here's the final steps:

<ol>
<li>Download the .xy file and the .m file. Put them both in the same directory.
<li>Using Stars!, open the .m file.
<li>Play your turn, and select Save and Submit.
<li>Upload the .x file that's in that directory (it's tiny, like 200 bytes).
<li>TotalHost will generate a new turn, and send you a new .m file (if you have selected Email Turns in your profile). You can also download the .m file from the web site. 
<li>Put the .m file in the directory you were using before (it's a good idea for this to be fairly automatic), save and submit your turn, and upload the new .x file.
</ol>
<P>Repeat as necessary.

<P>Although there's no real need for you to backup your .x, .m, or .xy file, you will be the only one with the .h file, which is the history file of the things you've discovered. Be sure to keep a backup of it. If you lose it, your universe will revert to an unexplored state. You can rebuild a lost .h file by downloading a game backup, opening Turn 2400, then 2401, then 2402, etc in the same folder. 

<ul>
<li>Beginner - barely played the game. No idea of what's going on. Crushed mere moments into the game.
<li>Novice - Good at strategy games in general, with little Stars! experience.
<li>Intermediate - Played the game a bit, multi-player experience.
<li>Advanced - Know the ins and outs of the game in general. Knowledge of art of race design.
<li>Expert - Better that the rest of that.
</ul>
