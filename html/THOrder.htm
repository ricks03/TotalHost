<p>Notes:
<p>
If you see a packet will hit your planet next turn and you don't
have a freighter already in orbit, there is nothing you can do; the 
packet will hit before you can build a mass driver or defenses and
before you can get any freighter there to move the pop.
<p>

If you plan on abandoning a planet to an ally by moving a freighter 
to the planet with orders to Set Waypoint to 1(00) on the same 
turn that the ally moves a freighter to the planet with orders to 
Unload All, the ally will face your entire population, not just the
100 colonists you had intended (a very painful lesson).
<p>
Remote Terraformers are very effective against narrow-hab CAs
since they terraform *after* the CA instaforms.
<p>
Since SD mine detonation occurs between fleet movement and
production, the arriving enemy fleet can be damaged while the
fleet that you produce that turn can enter combat undamaged.
<p>
If you intercept an enemy freighter going to meet the MT, you
can prevent him from trading.
<p>
A fleet that you give away will still be yours until the end of
combat (pre-"i" patch allowed waypoint 0 fleet transfers).
<p>
A fleet with a waypoint 0 load task in orbit around a planet that
you don't own will not proceed to waypoint 1 (very painful
Robber Baron lesson).
