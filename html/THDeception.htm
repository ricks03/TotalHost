<h1>The Art of Deception and Dismay (Draft)</h1>

<P>Sometimes it's not about what you know, but about what your opponent knows. And sometimes it's about what your opponent thinks they know. Confusing your enemy, as well as causing dismay, is another step on the road to victory.  

<h2>Race Design</h2>
<P>Planning for deception begins as early as your initial race design. Even from the first page of the Race Wizard you can start to wreak havoc - Make the singlular and the plural of your race name completely different! Some locations in Stars! show your singular name, and other the plural. 
Send Messages - plural
Minefield name - singular
Planet ownership - plural
Fleet display & Report - singular
Battle Display - plural

<P>Having your name not match can cause an opponent to lose track of the fact that you're two separate names. If you're lucky enough to have cooperative race design, naming them both the same thing, or swapping the singular and plural, can make it exceptionally difficult. 

<P>How your race is designed can tell your opponent a lot about how you'll play. The PRT is an obvious example, but there are others. If you have a high growth rate, you're also going to want a lot of room. Can you live on many planets, or only a few? Knowing how many factories and mines you might have can help determine how many resources / year a planet can produce, and thus maximum production capacity. 

<P>As mentioned previously, hiding your PRT can affect how your opponent's react. If they're going to know your PRT, at least hide that infromation until there's a reason!

<P>Many of the PRTs have race-specific parts which area a dead giveaway. Infinity star gates, the mini-colonizer, 

<P>Stealth hide by planet hopping
<P>Especially early in the game, it's easy to hide your true nature. Scrap your initial ships. 

<P>Note some things can be an early giveaway. 

<P>False intel on being attacked.

<P>Build scouts and name them what the other race would have. 
<P>Build scouts with no scanners, and you'll apepar like JOAT
<P>Early on, exchagne ships with another player. 

<h2>Ship Design</h2>
<P>Design a really expensive war ship. Build ONE. Engage the enemy so they learn the fleet design. Now scrap the fleet. Why? Because instead of deleting the design slot, you can now edit that design. Rip all the parts off, and build a pile of them. Make sure the enemy gets a good look at them in space - they'll show up in their display as the previous design as long as they don't actually encounter them. now your enemy needs to worry about where that fleet went, which tends to make them a LOT more cautious! Note: War Monger is the obvious exception to this trick - they know the design of a ship the instant it's scanned.

<P>Name different ships the same thing.

<P>Sending false messages

<h2>Misdirection</h2>
As you know (right?) you can select a ship on the map, and it will show which direction it's going, and the next waypoints. Many players than assume that's where it's going. But the waypoints displayed presume the ship keeps going ni the direction it was going last turn. But there's no reason you can't reorder it, or have previously given it orders to change direction. 

<P>However, if you're going to do this against a wary opponent, you have to put a little bit of extra effort into it. Why? Because ships always travel excetly how far they should at their present warp speed.  So if you set a waypoint that's 60 ly, and then issue a right turn, the wary opponent can see that the ship has an intermediate waypoint set - a good indicator the ship might turn.

<P>Along the same lines, you can also change your speed. If your opponent is looknig at the waypoints at warp 8, he might not catch that if you sped up to warp 9 you'd arrive a year earlier.
