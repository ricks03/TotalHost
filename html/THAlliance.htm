<H1>Stars! And the Alliance</H1>
<P>Last Updated: 130206

<P>Nope, not Star Wars! Joining up with your fellow galactic citizens.  It’s hard to go it alone, and one or more allies provides a buttress against a hostile galaxy. 
<H2>Habitability</H2>
<P>The ideal ally is one who picks up after itself, always puts the cap back on the toothpaste, and can only live on those places you cannot. The time to begin planning for an alliance is during race design. Even if you don’t know who your potential ally will be, you can make yourself more appealing. A race with middle-of-the road hab ranges will likely conflict with others for available planets. Conversely, a narrow, edge hab will conflict with almost no one.  And if your hab range doesn’t conflict, you gain more from an alliance, as there are more planets available to intersettle. 
<P><I>Note: Not that inter-settlement doesn’t have its risks. It’s a good idea to have planets adjacent to an ally’s planets have good planetary defenses. That will blunt any potential betrayal and buy you time to respond.</I>
<H2>Technology</H2>	
<P>The advantage to an alliance is pooling your resources, and the most direct way is by trading technology (See also <a href="http://wiki.starsautohost.org/wiki/Guts_of_Tech_Trading">The Guts of Tech Trading</a>) . While possible to transfer technology via Wolf-Lamb and Pop Drop, both have the limitations of requiring multiple instances to work quickly and effectively, as well as require some level of adjacency and a level of timing. Pop Drop is hard to transfer a specific technology. Wolf-Lamb will occasionally have the Wolf get eaten (how ignoble!). Both are hard to get going again if something goes wrong, and tends to consume an abnormal number of ship design slots.  
<P>Conversely, Scrapping is quick and easy. Build cheap scouts with at least one component of a higher technology than your ally, and drive/gate them to your ally. Build enough to have to do it only once to advance your ally to equal level. If you build them all in one turn, and transfer them the next turn, it can free the slot back up. Each year, split a fleet of 5 into individual fleets each year and scrap them at a star base for a ~75% chance of a technology transfer. It actually doesn’t matter which player does it – take that into account if one player has more ship slots available than the other.
<H2>Ships</H2>
<P>Unless it’s a highly coordinated alliance, it’s difficult to effectively transfer warships between one another, but there are additional options. One warship design that can be readily adapted to an alliance is the venerable chaff ship design. Even if your ally is behind in tech, that’s also no barrier to building perfectly capable chaff ships for donation. 
<P>But there is more than one way to leverage ship construction. If one player builds (and maintains) the mine layers, that frees up an additional slot for the ally, as they don’t have to maintain mine-laying ships. If one ally is technologically more advanced than their ally, they can donate their old designs to their ally, who might gain more use out of them (if not just scrapping them for tech), and free that slot for new construction. 
<h2>Ship Designs</h2>
<P>A key part of Stars! combat is ship design. Who has the highest initiative matters, but what if the Opposition puts all of their Electrical slots on Jamming? What if those ships in turn run into Beam ships that put all of their Electrical parts on Capacitors? Typical ship design involves determining your enemy’s most current ship design, and designing your next generation with that knowledge.  As players struggle to one-up the opposition, it’s all the more difficult when trying to have the best design against two different fleets.
<H2>Battle</H2>
<P>It is often said that two heads are better than one (and if your ally has more than one head all the better!). Two warfleets are much the same. As well as the additional firepower, note that additional players in a battle change the placement on the board. This can make beam ships more effective, because they potentially start out closer to the enemy, and this can fire earlier. You start out closer to their missile ships, as well as the chance that their chaff ships die a critical turn early.
<P>You have to plan carefully though, as an unknown number of players can lead to unexpected results.  Starting position on the board is pre-determined, and based on the player order; i.e. the third race in order will always start in the same relative position, so the enemy might end up right next to someone and get of a critical first shot with their beamers against unshielded chaff if you don’t know who will be in the fight.
<H2>Racial Traits</H2>
<H3>Interstellar Traveller </H3>
<P>IT lend themselves well to an alliance. Because they can gate population, they can rapidly have colonies up and running within their ally’s space from almost anywhere. With an Infinity gate in their ally’s space, allies can benefit from long-distance transit with little damage and few losses. 
<P>Due to their pursuit of the bestest farthest star gates, IT early on have high Propulsion and Construction to contribute.
<H3>War Monger</H3>
<P>More than any race but AR, WM need allies. But almost any ally can fill in the main weakness of the WM – providing mine laying at their planets and even the donation of mine laying ships. If you’re looking at planetary invasion, the WM troops are 1.5 times more effective (also meaning it’s a good idea to have a high growth as WM, because your people are shock troops more often than not), so they make an ideal ground support in a war effort.
<P>While it’s hard to capitalize on sharing ship designs, the WM Battle Cruiser is stunningly powerful. Facilitating a large WM fleet of BCs can be a valuable asset. Note: An ally with the entirety of the war fleet has its own inherent risks
<H3>Hyper Expansion</H3>
<P>HE has several limiting factors that allies offset. They need room, which an ally of dissimilar habitat ranges can provide. They also need star gates to offset their limited 100/250 gates and bring their economic power to a rapid focal point. 
<P>Early on the HE also gains the Flux Capacitor, making them the ally to take the lead in early beam ship construction. 
<H3>Space Demolition</H3>
<P>SD have no major weakness, but they’re a benefit to any alliance. Mine-laying comes immediately to mind. But there’s more depth than that. They can (with care) provide detonating minefields (note detonating mines will impact their ally as well). As they already have mine-laying ships and fleets, they can “free up” ship design slots for their ally because the ally can abstain from building mine layers. SD also tend to have better Bio than any other race, so are ready to contribute BioTech (if nothing else helping to increase miniaturization). 
<P>SD can also contribute ships with the Energy Dampener, slowing down beam ships and making missile ships more effective.  Note if this is the plan, you probably don’t want multiple players’ fleets in a battle, as that puts them closer to one another. 
<H3>Inner Strength</H3>
<P>IS has one great gift, especially in a universe of SS – Stealth-detecting ships built with the Tachyon Detector. The TD nullifies to a great extent the core racial advantage of SS. That in turn makes the two natural allies.
<P>IS is one of only two races that can contribute Speed Bump mine layers, although they should be designed to make them readily gateable. Late in the game, IS can also build warships jammed better than anyone else (with 50% jammers), making them the natural ally to build ships in need of jamming.  Conversely, Weapons construction is expensive for IS, so they can benefit by others building ships for them.
<H3>Super Stealth  </H3>
<P>SS can transfer highly cloaked ships to their opponent for scanning, mine sweeping, deep raids and bombing runs. Stealth can also take over mineral shipments for both players, with their ability to (with the Pick Pocket) pick up minerals from their ally’s planets, potentially freeing up a Freighter design slot. 
<H3>Packet Physics</H3>
<P>PP can offer Energy tech, but little else. A cost of a careful alliance with a PP is having to maintain planetary defenses throughout the empire. They are a dangerous ally, as intersettling can mean dozens of packets travelling at high speeds in the heart of your empire in the case of a reversal. IT are at even higher risk due to their vulnerability to packets.
<H3>Alternate Reality</H3>
<P>There is no PRT that needs an ally more that AR. Out of the gate AR are vulnerable to almost everyone. They can offer Energy tech. With no factory building, AR has germanium available to its allies, and to the patient and deserving ally, late in the game they can provide a vast plentitude minerals.
<H3>Claim Adjustor</H3>
<P>CA have one gift of benefit to every ally lareg and small  – the Orbital Adjustor, which not only provides “free” terraforming, but also the chance to increase the base value of a planet. 
<H3>Advanced Remote Mining and Only Basic Remote Mining</H3>
<P>Any race that picked one of these LRTs did so with an impact to their overall economy. If an ally can contribute mining ships, they disproportionately bolster their ally’s base race design.
<H3>No Advanced Scanners</H3>
<P>A contribution of only a few ships with advanced scanners to an ally almost completely offsets the penalty of having selected this option. Your ally will have much better intelligence, which in turn means you will as well. 
<H2>Player Relations </H2>
<P>When considering an alliance, you have to consider how far you’re going to go in the Player Relations options. Neutral serves little purpose over Enemy except for permitting adjusting your Battle Orders to avoid an incident. Where the metal meets the meat you must set your ally to Friend. They immediately gain, for better or worse, full access to your star gates and immunity to your minefields. They also refuel at your star bases. 
<H2>Critical Information</H2>
<P>There are a few key elements your allies need to know:
<UL>
<LI>Where you have star gates, and the mass/range rating
<LI>What your current tech levels are
<LI>What your research costs are
<LI>what weakness you have they might fill in
<LI>Known tech levels, ship designs, large fleet locations of the enemy, and an estimate of where they’re headed. Note if you want to ask about an unknown ship design, ship weight can help define which ship you’re curious about.
</UL> 
<P>Once a baseline is established, each turn you need but to update that information as appropriate.  It’s very important to plan for and keep track of your ally’s tech levels when preparing to tech trading. You want an attempt to trade tech every single year. 
<H2>Summary</H2>
<P>There are many separate benefits that come with an alliance. None of them are significant individually – each provides just a piece of the puzzle. If you’re just on the same side but barely interacting, you’re just two separate collections of resources. Much like two separate fleets, you’re not nearly as strong as a single combined stack. To get the true benefits of an alliance you need to go all in. Remember that anything that makes your ally stronger makes your enemy weaker, making you stronger in turn. If you’re producing more resources than your ally, then you’ll stay that way even if they’re gaining tech from you. If you’re producing fewer resources than your ally, then this is your opportunity to try to catch up. Everyone benefits from a strong alliance.
<P>Now, once your enemy is weaker than your ally and yourself, perhaps it’s time for a new alliance, but that’s a topic for another time …
