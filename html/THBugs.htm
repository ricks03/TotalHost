<h2>Stars! Bugs</h2>
<h2>When used to your advantage, generally considered cheats</h3>

Generally from <a href="http://wiki.starsautohost.org/wiki/Known_Bugs">http://wiki.starsautohost.org/wiki/Known_Bugs</a> and  <a href="http://www.starsfaq.com/rgcsfaq.htm">The Stars! FAQ</a>

<P><ul>Race File Corruption</ul>: Editing the race name in an existing race file can cause file corruption. This is especially common when making the race name shorter than before. To get around this, when editing the race name, either edit it one letter at a time (saving and re-opening each time) or copy the race data into a new file by hand.

<P><ul>Random Race</ul>: If at any point during the race creation you select "random race" but then de-select it, that can cause the race to generate a random race every time you use that race to play a game. This is due to the random tag within the file not being unselected. Though it has been reported by others, I did a recent test of this, but could not activate it.


<P><ul>32k Ship Limit Per Fleet</ul>: There is a limit of 32k of any one type of ship in a fleet (32,767 to be precise). If you try and merge two fleets together which would push the ship count over this limit (i.e. a fleet with 25k chaff and another with 10k), Stars! will have problems. If done manually, the ship type will disappear from the fleet readout, but re-appear in the next generation (you will only lose ships in excess of the 32k). But if done using the "merge with fleet" waypoint order, all the ships of that type will disappear. This is because when the integer (16 bit - signed) holding the number of ships goes over the 32k limit it becomes negative, and as you can't have a negative number of ships, it reads as 0. There are also some other limits in the game: 512 separate fleets, 512 separate minefields, 16 ship designs, 10 starbase designs, 256 tokens at a battle. The game will not allow you to exceed these limits.


<P><ul>AR Starter Colonies</ul>: Starter colonies for AR races will not contribute excess resources to research unless the build queue is cleared first (using the clear button) or the hull design is changed / upgraded. This is due to the "build Starter Colony" order invisibly blocking the end of the queue despite the fact that it has already been completed. 

<P><ul>Failing to Close to Range 2 with Sappers and R2 Beams</ul>: In the battle VCR, if a token of ships is armed with both sappers and range 2 beams, and is facing an enemy token for which it has enough power in its sappers to completely take down its shields to 0 dp in a single volley, then the ship will not attempt to move into range 2 in that turn even if it has spare movement points and regardless of the given battle orders (even with maximize damage). If the token lacks the sapper firepower to deplete all the shields then the token will close to range 2 as normal. The exact logic code-wise behind this bug has not been figured out yet. 


<P><ul>Copy Protection Activates When Editing an Allies Turn File</ul>: When you save and submit a turn and then transfer the .x file to another computer (which is being used by another player in the game) and then re-open the turn and then re-save and submit before finally turning over the file to the host, it can cause the copy protection to kick in. The solution is to open the turn file up, delete the .x file while stars is still running and then save and submit, the newly created .x file will be safe to send to the host for generation. The reason for this bug is that the machine's hardware hash is only written to the .x file when the .x file is being created and not updated on subsequent save and submit, whereas the Stars! serial number is updated each time. When you open up your allies turn file, his hardware hash is already encoded into the .x file, but when you update the file with a new save and submit, your Stars! serial number is added to the file replacing his. Thus the host during generation sees the same serial number on two turn files but both with different hardware hashes. For more information, see the section on the Copy Protection Features www.starsfaq.com/copy_protection.htm. 

<P>Ship Transfers: Transferring ships to your opponent(s) with the intention to prevent them from receiving  receiving allies' or MT ships, as preference is given to the player with the highest ID.

<P>Mine North/South Immunity: There is an unusual bug in which there are no minefield hit checks done do a fleet traveling exactly due north or due south. Though the checks are carried out if there is even 1 light year of east/west movement. This could allow a player to travel through a minefield at warp 10 with a 0% chance of hitting a mine. Use of this is considered cheating.

<P>Mine East/West Speed Bump Immunity: A similar bug to the one above, but this time affecting only speed bump fields for fleet traveling due east or west.

<P>Mine Damage Dodge: If you have two different ships in one fleet, the first one in your design pool will take 4/5 of the damage, and the second one will take 1/5. You can (ab)use this to for example give your DD sweepers a longer life span. Pairing one (shielded) DD with a chaff (with the chaff in a design slot somewhere above the DD) makes sure the DD will survive a hit from a standard minefield with minimum damage (1/5). To achieve this otherwise you would need to use 5 of such DDs in one fleet.

<P>Colonizaton Bug. Strange thing - if you make a copy of the starting colonizer design (Santa Maria, Spore Cloud, Pinta) without the Colonization module, the copy can still colonize a planet. However the slot where the Colonization module was must remain empty. This also works for a copy of any ship design that had a Colonization module. 

<P>[freepop] Hack: Using a memory editing utility it is possible to create colonists out of thin air, limited only by a player's freighter capacity, with the help of a memory editor. This abuses a lack of a viability check for loading colonist from an uninhabited planet, usually you cannot load more colonists than you drop down in a turn, but a memory editor can be used to trick the user interface into believing that you had dropped down millions of colonists, and the host doesn't double check these figures. Use of this in a multiplayer game would be considered by most players to be a totally inexcusable cheating offence.

<P>Cheap Starbase: If you build an EMPTY starbase on a planet which has no base yet, and finish it to 99%, then next turn you can still EDIT the design, add all the weap and armor you like, and the base is still 99% finished. This means you only pay 1% of the full armed base, and 99% for the empty base. 

<P>Mineral Upload: Stars! allows you to upload minerals to any fleet in orbit that does not belong to you. You can even do this if that fleet does not have a cargo hold. This causes the minerals to "disappear". People have abused this bug to deny the salvage of a battle from their enemy by uploading the minerals from the surface to the enemies warfleet/bombers.
