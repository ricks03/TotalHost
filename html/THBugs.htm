<h2>Stars! Bugs</h2>
<h3>When used to your advantage, generally considered cheats. Totalhost can detect (and even attempt to fix) for a number of common issues.</h3>

Generally from <a href="http://wiki.starsautohost.org/wiki/Known_Bugs">http://wiki.starsautohost.org/wiki/Known_Bugs</a> and  <a href="http://www.starsfaq.com/rgcsfaq.htm">The Stars! FAQ</a>

<P><u>FIXED in TOTALHOST: Colonization Bug:</u> If you edit an existing colonizer design and remove the Colonization module, the copy can still colonize a planet. However the slot where the Colonization module was must remain empty. This also works for a copy of any ship design that had a Colonization module. 

<P><u>FIXED in TOTALHOST: Space Dock Armor slot Buffer Overflow</u> If your race has ISB and RS, building a Space Dock with more than 21 SuperLat in the Armor slot will result in some sort of error. 21 SuperLat gives a Space Dock 16,000 armor, 22 SuperLat gives it 49,518 Armor. For a full 24 SuperLat stack, you get a whopping 51,018 armor. In comparison, a Death Star for an RS AR tops out at 31,500 armor (not including M.T. toys). 

<P><u>FIXED in TOTALHOST: Starbase Friendly Fire:</u> In battles where a starbase is present, the player owning the starbase can change the "attack who" in his Default battle orders to make friends fire upon each other. Latest bug description by Ptolemy: Ptolemy wrote on Tue, 22 November 2005 20:14
<li>1. The Default order for the defender must be set to attack any of the attacking players specifically.
<li>2. The highest attacking player number will attack his ally with the lowest player number. If there are 3 or more allies attacking only 2 of them will shoot at each other. The highest and lowest player numbers. This is not an absolute guarantee since battle sims would need to be done with 7 or 8 players to check the effects.
<li>The effect with 3 or more allies when the defender default orders are set to attack everyone is slightly different in that it results in a free for all with all ships trying to kill each other.
<li>The player under attack with the SB must change his default orders to 'attack neutrals and enemies' or 'attack enemies' and may not use 'attack everyone' for his default battle plan.

<P><u>FIXED in TOTALHOST: Cheap Starbase:</u> If you build an EMPTY starbase on a planet which has no base yet, and finish it to 99%, then next turn you can still EDIT the design, add all the weap and armor you like, and the base is still 99% finished. This means you only pay 1% of the full armed base, and 99% for the empty base. 

<P><u>FIXED in TOTALHOST: Race File Corruption:</u> Editing the race name in an existing race file can cause file corruption. This is especially common when making the race name shorter than before. To get around this, when editing the race name, either edit it one letter at a time (saving and re-opening each time) or copy the race data into a new file by hand. Totalhost can display an un uploaded race even when Stars! won't display it, and will fix uploaded race files.

<P><u>WARNING in TOTALHOST: Crash Stars Bug:</u> When Player 1's fleet 1 refuels at a planet and the final player has a starbase design occupying his 10th starbase design slot stars can crash. Ways to avoid the crash are for a dummy race to be placed in the final slot so the 10th starbase slot is never used, for player 1 to keep his fleet 1 away from planets and for it not to be destroyed either in a battle or in a minefield or to have an experienced player as the final player and for them not to use the 10th starbase slot.

<P><u>FIXED in JRC4. Mine North/South Immunity:</u> There is an unusual bug in which there are no minefield hit checks done do a fleet traveling exactly due north or due south. Though the checks are carried out if there is even 1 light year of east/west movement. This could allow a player to travel through a minefield at warp 10 with a 0% chance of hitting a mine. Use of this is considered cheating.

<P><u>FIXED in JRC4. Mine East/West Speed Bump Immunity:</u> A similar bug to the one above, but this time affecting only speed bump fields for fleet traveling due east or west.

<P><u>FIXED in JRC4. AR Starter Colonies:</u> Starter colonies for AR races will not contribute excess resources to research unless the build queue is cleared first (using the clear button) or the hull design is changed / upgraded. This is due to the "build Starter Colony" order invisibly blocking the end of the queue despite the fact that it has already been completed. 

<P><u>FIXED IN JRC4 (& TOTALHOST). SS Pop Steal:</u> The robber baron scanner can steal minerals from an enemy player, though a player cannot usually steal enemy colonists. Though in the J patch, the check for seeing if the player wishes to steal enemy colonists was disabled when using the waypoint 1 task option (Transport|colonists|load all). This was not intended. This bug has been proved to unbalance the game when used. Most if not all players would consider use of this bug to be very serious "cheating" unless "specifically" stated by the host prior the start of the game.
JRC4 Fix caveat: Mineral transfers must be done by hand, not as a waypoint task.

<P><u>Random Race:</u> If at any point during the race creation you select "random race" but then de-select it, that can cause the race to generate a random race every time you use that race to play a game. This is due to the random tag within the file not being unselected. Though it has been reported by others, I did a recent test of this, but could not activate it.

<P><u>32k Ship Limit Per Fleet:</u> There is a limit of 32k of any one type of ship in a fleet (32,767 to be precise). If you try and merge two fleets together which would push the ship count over this limit (i.e. a fleet with 25k chaff and another with 10k), Stars! will have problems. If done manually, the ship type will disappear from the fleet readout, but re-appear in the next generation (you will only lose ships in excess of the 32k). The UI will try to grey out the transfer button if you're clicking slow enough, but there's a race condition. But if done using the "merge with fleet" waypoint order, all the ships of that type will disappear. This is because when the integer (16 bit - signed) holding the number of ships goes over the 32k limit it becomes negative, and as you can't have a negative number of ships, it reads as 0. There are also some other limits in the game: 512 separate fleets, 512 separate minefields, 16 ship designs, 10 starbase designs, 256 tokens at a battle. The game will not allow you to exceed these limits.

<P><u>Failing to Close to Range 2 with Sappers and R2 Beams:</u> In the battle VCR, if a token of ships is armed with both sappers and range 2 beams, and is facing an enemy token for which it has enough power in its sappers to completely take down its shields to 0 dp in a single volley, then the ship will not attempt to move into range 2 in that turn even if it has spare movement points and regardless of the given battle orders (even with maximize damage). If the token lacks the sapper firepower to deplete all the shields then the token will close to range 2 as normal. The exact logic code-wise behind this bug has not been figured out yet. 

<P><u>Copy Protection Activates When Editing an Allies Turn File:</u> When you save and submit a turn and then transfer the .x file to another computer (which is being used by another player in the game) and then re-open the turn and then re-save and submit before finally turning over the file to the host, it can cause the copy protection to kick in. The solution is to open the turn file up, delete the .x file while stars is still running and then save and submit, the newly created .x file will be safe to send to the host for generation. The reason for this bug is that the machine's hardware hash is only written to the .x file when the .x file is being created and not updated on subsequent save and submit, whereas the Stars! serial number is updated each time. When you open up your allies turn file, his hardware hash is already encoded into the .x file, but when you update the file with a new save and submit, your Stars! serial number is added to the file replacing his. Thus the host during generation sees the same serial number on two turn files but both with different hardware hashes. For more information, see the StarsFAQ section on <a href="http://www.starsfaq.com/copy_protection.htm">Copy Protection Features</a>. 

<P><u>Ship Transfers:</u> Transferring ships to your opponent(s) with the intention to prevent them from receiving allies' or MT ships, as preference is given to the player with the highest ID.

<P><u>Mine Damage Dodge:</u> If you have two different ships in one fleet, the first one in your design pool will take 4/5 of the damage, and the second one will take 1/5. You can (ab)use this to for example give your DD sweepers a longer life span. Pairing one (shielded) DD with a chaff (with the chaff in a design slot somewhere above the DD) makes sure the DD will survive a hit from a standard minefield with minimum damage (1/5). To achieve this otherwise you would need to use 5 of such DDs in one fleet.

<P><u>FIXED IN TOTALHOST: Mineral Upload:</u> Stars! allows you to upload minerals to any fleet in orbit that does not belong to you. You can even do this if that fleet does not have a cargo hold. This causes the minerals to "disappear". People have abused this bug to deny the salvage of a battle from their enemy by uploading the minerals from the surface to the enemies warfleet/bombers. Note a 32k limit regardless of fleet size. 
 
<P><u>WP0 pop reload ignored:</u> If:

<li>a waypoint zero unload by hand of any of your population over an uninhabited planet is performed
<li>a waypoint zero dropdown command of "Colonize" is given to a fleet with a colonizer module present over that planet
<li>the population is reloaded by hand
<li>Then: the reload order will be ignored and not saved with your turn. ALL pop will die (even the colonist that you did not unload) and the planet will remain uninhabited. A possible solution is to split the fleet into multiple fleets with cargo space and merge them back. If there is only one ship you'll have to redo your turn.

<P><u>FIXED IN JRC4? [freepop] Hack:</u> Using a memory editing utility it is possible to create colonists out of thin air, limited only by a player's freighter capacity, with the help of a memory editor. This abuses a lack of a viability check for loading colonist from an uninhabited planet, usually you cannot load more colonists than you drop down in a turn, but a memory editor can be used to trick the user interface into believing that you had dropped down millions of colonists, and the host doesn't double check these figures. Use of this in a multiplayer game would be considered by most players to be a totally inexcusable cheating offence.
