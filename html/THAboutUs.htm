<P>I've been playing Stars! a long time -- since its initial release. I even still have my original floppy disc for my Registered copy of Stars! v. 1.0. At one point I was the most prolific poster on the rec.computer.games.stars! newsgroup. That is, until Jason Cawley came along. Jason was a juggernaut on the site, and his insights and analysis of the game changed the very nature of how the game was played. 

<P>Ron Miller published (and continued to improve) the Stars! AutoHost site, which revolutionized on-line hosting. However, it never quite did all the things I wanted a hosting site to do, so I continued to host my games manually. 

<P>Eventually I decided to build my own hosting site. After all, how hard could it be? Well, after working on it for a while, development stalled some time in 2004, and mostly never started up again. That code base went on to help solve a number of OTHER programming projects, but I never finished the actual Stars! hosting code. 

<P>Returning to Stars! many years later I still had the same desires for hosting I had previously. I have considerably more programming experience, but at the same time, the Internet had changed, and most of what I had done was no longer compatible with how people expected sites to function. 

<P>So, back to the drawing board. I've now integrated all of that older code into my more "modern" programming (for all that it's still Perl). While I continue to add features, it finally does what I want it to do - host Stars!

<P>The AutoHost site is also a LOT of information. It's great, but there's so much it's hard to find any one thing. So I've distilled down those resources to the things that I think are the most useful to a new player. Once you have your feet under you, spend a while rummaging about on AutoHost. 

<P>I hope you find the site useful. It's really got only the basics of information, as I have no urge to replicate (or replace) the community centered around the AutoHost site. But the site does the thing I wanted it to do, the way I wanted to do it. 

<P>Peace (through superior firepower). 

<P>Rick
