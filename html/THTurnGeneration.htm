<H2>Turn Generation</H2>

<P>The system checks for whether all turns are in every 10 minutes. If
<ul>
<li>all turns are in, and the configuration is to generate when all turns are in, or
<li>the current time is on or after the next turn generation time
</ul>
a new turn will be generated, and the next due date will be set. 

<P>Turns will be emailed to all players who have selected <i>Send Turns via Email</i> in their Profile. A host not playing in the game will also receive notifications.

<H3>So, exactly when <b>will</b> your next turn be due?</h3>

<P>Turns are generated by 4 methods:
<OL>
<li>Turns generated Daily</li>

<P>For Daily Turns, a turn will be generated whenever the hosting program checks for turns (normally every 10 minutes), and finds that the current time is later than when the turn was due to be generated. The time will be advanced to the next acceptable day, as indicated by the <i>Days to Generate</i> value.

<P>If <i>As Available</i> has been selected for the game, turns will be generated whenever all turns have been submitted, regardless of any other set values. The clock will advance from the generation time as normal, UNLESS the game is currently flagged as "Delayed". 

<P><B>Exceptions:</b>
<P>For the <i>Days to Generate</i> value, turns will only be generated on selected days. <i>Hours to Generate</i> will be ignored.

<P>If <i>Observe Holidays</i> has been selected, when a Next turn is set, it will advance over the holiday to the next day that is acceptable according to <i>Days to Generate</i>.

<P>If <i>As Available</i> has been selected for the game, turns will be generated whenever all turns have been submitted, regardless of any other set values. The clock will advance, UNLESS the game is currently flagged as "Delayed". 

<li>Turns generated Hourly</li>

<P>For Turns Generated Hourly, turns will be generated whenever the hosting program checkes for turns (normally every 10 minutes), and finds that the current time is later than the time when the turn was due to be generated. The time will then advance the appropriate number of hours. 

<P><B>Exceptions:</b>

If the next scheduled turn is an invalid Hour, Day or a Holiday (where applicable), the next time will advance until the Hour and Day is valid, and then advance in hours until the hour is also valid.
<P>If <i>As Available</i> has been selected for the game, turns will be generated whenever all turns have been submitted. The hourly count will reset.

<P>For the <i>Days to Generate</i> value, turns will only be generated on selected days. If a turn falls on a day where it should not generate, it will advance one hour at a time until the day is ok. For the <i>Hours to Generate</i> value, the time will be advanced one hour at a time until is hits an allowable hour.

<P>If <i>Observe Holidays</i> has been selected, the game will advance one hour at a time until it no longer believes it to be a holiday.

<li>Turns Generated when all turns are in.</li>

<P>As you might guess, these turns are only generated when all players have submitted a valid turn. Inactive players will not prevent turns from generating.

<li>As Required</li>

<P>For As Required games, turns will only generate when the Host generates a turn. 
</OL>

<h3>As Available</h3>

<P>If the Game has "As Available" enabled, turns will generate when all active players have submitted turns. When the next turn is due will depend on a number of things. 

<P>If the Game has been delayed, the next date will not advance unless less than one interval. 

<P>If the Game due date is off in the future somewhere, but the game is no longer delayed, the due date will not advance if it's already more than one interval in the future. The end effect is if many turns are generated because everyone is busily submitting turns early, the due date won't advance to some distant point in the future. In other words, submitting turns in advance won't wildly extend when the next turn is due. This shouldn't ever catch anyone by surprise, because if you're not submitting turns, the due date will be right when you expect it to be. 

<h3>Game Delays</h3>
<P>If the game is configured to allow players to delay when a turn is due, players can advance/delay when the next turn is due by one (or more) intervals. 

<P>IF a player then continues to submit turns, turns will generate. Each time a turn generates, it decreases the current delay by one. This means Delays will actually reset if you delay the game and then continue to take turns. (Handy if you only needs a brief delay to get your turn in). 

<h3>Game Modification</h3>
<P>If the game allows the host to modify Parameters, the host can change from one set of parameters to another, but the due date and how it's calculated will not change until the next turn generation. Whatever due date is in effect when turn generation takes effect will take precedence.
