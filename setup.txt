Extremely brief instructions to get the TotalHost website running on a windows XP-32 system.

Resolve the usual DNS related issues. Known your domain name and admin addresses. 

Install and patch XP
	Do not install IIS

Install Activestate Perl (version: 5.14.2.1402 32 bit)
	Using PPM, install win32::ODBC and CGI/Session.pm, MIME::Lite, CGI::Session::Auth, MIME-tools, io-socket-ssl, mail::pop3client, MIME::Parser, Mail::POP3Client, File::Copy::Recursive;

Make sure you have cgi-lib.pl in c:\perl\lib

http://community.activestate.com/faq/activeperl-and-apache-cgi

Download and install Junction

Link /usr to c:\perl (to make perl consistent across platforms)
junction c:\usr c:\perl
Or just install perl in the c:\usr folder

Install Apache (Windows version 2.2.22) and update httpd.conf as appropriate. Don't forget to get perl working. 
Enable Virtual Hosts
Update ServerAdmin
Update ServerName

LoadFile "C:/Perl/bin/perl514.dll"      (dependent on the version of perl)
LoadModule perl_module modules/mod_perl.so
DocumentRoot "C:/TH/html"

<Directory />
    Options FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride None
</Directory>
DirectoryIndex index.html index.htm


# Virtual hosts
Include conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf


, and httpd-vhost.conf as below (correcting for file path)
## Root Totalhost.com
<VirtualHost *:999>
    ServerAdmin webmaster@example.com
    DocumentRoot "D:/TH/html"
    ServerName 127.0.0.1
    ServerAlias www.example.com
    ErrorLog "logs/TH_error.log"
    CustomLog "logs/TH_access.log" common
    <Directory "/">

</VirtualHost>





Install Stars! (Activate with License key, update .ini)

set up DSN on XP in the Control Panel > Administrative Tools > Data Sources (ODBC)  for "TotalHost" (or user specified).

Create a scheduled task to run TurnMake.pl at whatever interval you would like to check. 

update config.pl with all the correct information.
	Currently requires a SMTP server that does not require authentication
	
Create a scheduled task to check turns as often as you'd like: 
From the Windows 7 Command line: 
schtasks /create /sc minute /mo 1 /tn "Task Name" /tr c:\temp\filename.exe


Movies
For movies to work, you'll need to install imagemagick and Starmappper 121 and update the information in the config.p; file. You'll also need java installed:
jre-7u80-windows-i586.exe

I also had to update starmapper.bat to run from a different directory: 
@echo off
set STARMAPPERPARAMS=
:loop
set STARMAPPERPARAMS=%STARMAPPERPARAMS% %1
shift
if %1.==. goto endargs
goto loop
:endargs
::java -Xmx128MB -classpath .;Starmapper.jar jezuch.utils.starmapper.Starmapper %STARMAPPERPARAMS%
java -classpath .;d:\th\utils\starmapper\starmapper121\Starmapper.jar jezuch.utils.starmapper.Starmapper %STARMAPPERPARAMS%
set STARMAPPERPARAMS=
