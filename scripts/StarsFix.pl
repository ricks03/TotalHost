# Return Ship, Fleet, Queue, and Battle block attributes
# Example Usage: StarsFix.pl c:\stars\game.m1
#
# Derived from decryptor.py and decryptor.java from
# https://github.com/stars-4x/starsapi  

# An "upgrade" of StarsShip.pl & StarsShipQueue.pl & StarsFleet.pl
# Detects, and mostly can fix and detect fixes of:
# Cheap Colonizer (Design)
# Cheap Starbase (Design & Producton Queue )
# 10th Starbase (Design)
# Starbase Friendly Fire Battle Plan (Battle Plan)
# Space Dock Armor Slot Buffer Overflow (Design)
# Mineral Upload  (Manual Load)
# SS Pop Steal  (Waypoint Change)
# 32k merge     (Waypoint Change or Move/Merge Fleet)                                             
# FreePop (code mostly written but untested as I can't replicte)
#    Testing suggests modifying the .x file and/or the .m file return "unable" on generation.

# The check for Cheap Starbase requires a .queue file to detect the fix.
# Mineral Upload requires a .fleet file for fleet cargo capacity.
