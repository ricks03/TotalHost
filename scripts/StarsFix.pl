# Return Ship, Fleet, Waypoint, Queue, and Battle block attributes
# Example Usage: StarsFix.pl c:\stars\game.m1
#
# Derived from decryptor.py and decryptor.java from
# https://github.com/stars-4x/starsapi  
# Detects, can fix, and can detect fixes of the colonizer, spacedock, 
# 10 starbase, cheap starbase, and friendly fire

# An "upgrade" of StarsShip.pl & StarsShipQueue. Adding in the abilty to check for 
# the Cheap Starbase exploit requires queue-awareness to detect the fix.


#BUG: I could massively speed this up by reading everything into hashes first
# then checking the results. At least for any of the fields with a unique
# way of identifying each record (not queue)
